**Still very much a work-in-progress**

# Cookiecutter CompBio

A [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for computational biology projects.

This uses cookiecutter to create a repository with a similar structure to what was described in [A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) by 
William Stafford Noble, while also implementing some additional best practices, such as code styling and data-versioning/pipelining (With [DVC](https://dvc.org/)).

Currently, it only supports a project with analyses in Python and manuscript writing in LaTeX, R Markdown or "Other". 
In the future I'll hopefully get rid of these limitations.
